*If playing on mobile, make sure to play horizontally!*

## Brief
Cribbage is a game very near and dear to my heart. It was taught to me by my grandfather at a young age and is essentially my family's tradition at this point. I wanted to put my coding skills to the test and create a fully playable, in-browser cribbage experience. 
So I did just that, and thus *Viaduct Cribbage* was born.

## Project Details
This app was created from essentially the ground up, using React Native and Framer-Motion as my only foundation. All game logic, components, and everything else inbetween was coded from scratch by me. It took just about ~1900 lines of code to complete and I lost track of the hours spent at this point. The only outside help was lies in beautiful, royalty-free library of playing card SVGs I found, which are credited below. 

## Built With

- Node.js
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
